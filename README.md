# openCane

The Interesting Powder mod, but it's Open Source, Unlicense, and most importantly, not made in MCreator.
This mod adds a new item: C-cane. It can be confused as an energy source, and it's very efficient at doing so when you start consuming it, but using it too much may lead to issues.

# Additions:

## C-cane:

A powdery item that can be crafted and consumed for saturation and haste.

<!-- Planned Features

## C-plant

A plant used to craft C-cane

## C-bag (?)

A bundle-like bag you can use to store C-cane or C-plant

## C-table

A villager profession table that can be used to generate or turn villagers into a type that sells C-cane.
